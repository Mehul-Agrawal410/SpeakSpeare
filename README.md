In today's world, AI and machine learning are everywhere. We want to offer you a chance to learn about NLP and transformer models. Have you ever wondered how ChatGPT works so well? We'll teach you the basics of coding for machine learning and then dive into NLP. You'll learn about attention mechanisms and transformer models, which are big in NLP. We'll even show you how to train a chatbot using Shakespeare's language. It might be a bit tough for beginners, but with time and effort, you can do it.

## Problem Statement 

To make a Chatbot that speaks in Shakespearean language

## Project Phases

### [Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Python](<./Week 1/>)
This week will be a lighter one for those already familiar with Python. For those who are new, we have got you covered. 
- [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) : Watch till 3:36:00, try to write the code and try running them, this goes for all further tutorials 
- [Python Classes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-classes-and-objects/)
- [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)
- [Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)
- [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB9C0Mz9gSo)

Assignment : Test your Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib concepts
- [W1_Assignment1](<./Week 1/Assignment_1.ipynb>) 
- [W1_Assignment1 dataset](<./Week 1/countries.csv>)
- [Assignment1 submission](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1t3v59_KHsocnrBmoRrTOebCyTRmbVJUC1tadpePolEU/edit?ts=65854ff4)

NOTE : 
- You have to submit the Collab link of the assignment with comment acsess, the google form will be floated on the group
- Do not use ChatGpt
- This applies for all further assignments

### [Week 2: Introduction to Neural Networks and Pytorch](<./Week 2/>)
This week we will learn about what Neural Networds are and how we can implement them using Pytorch
- [Neural Network and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) : You do not need to enroll for the course, you can audit all the content for free (apply for financial aid, then there will be a option to audit the course). You do not need to solve the assignments, just watch the videos on X2. Try to get the basic feel of what AndreNG is trying to teach, it's okay if you don't get all the concepts but going through it at least once is recommended, with time you will get a deeper understanding of it.
- Alternate resources for NN and DL (optional) : [MIT lecture series](https://youtu.be/QDX-1M5Nj7s) and [3Blue1Brown](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
- [Pytorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M) : There will be few new terms such as “linear regression”, “logistic regression” first try to look at google to understand them, if you don’t find relevant resources put on group or DM us ( NOTE : Able to find good resources and documentation is a very important skill while coding)

Assignment : Implementation of Neural Networks using Pytorch
- [W2_Assignment1](<./Week 2/NN_using_PyTorch.ipynb>) 
- [W2_Assignment1 dataset](<./Week 2/pizza_vs_not.zip>)

### [Week 3: Diving into Natural Language Processing](<./Week 3/>)
Now that you've gained an insight into implementing neural networks, let's shift our focus to the main topic - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFJeN9V1ZsI) : Another great library, It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks
- [Word Embeddings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMrHM8a3hqw) : Neural networks cannot process words directly; they deal only with numerical vectors and their computations. In order to feed text as input to a neural network, we will first need to convert it into vector form, using word embeddings. There exist many different techniques (TF-IDF, Skip-gram, CBOW) and implementations (Glove, FastText, etc.) for this purpose.
- [Text Preprocessing](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/text-preprocessing-in-nlp-with-python-codes/) : Real word text is often not in a format appropriate for analysis. Things like spelling mistakes, punctuations, tenses and more complex concepts of a language are difficult to translate into vector representations. To clean up and simplify the input data, we use several preprocessing techniques. Refer to the below link on the same.
- [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) : Complete the first two weeks of this course. You do not need to enroll for the course, you can audit all the content for free (apply for financial aid, then there will be a option to audit the course). You do not need to solve the assignments, just watch the videos on X2. Try to get the basic feel of what AndreNG is trying to teach, it's okay if you don't get all the concepts but going through it at least once is recommended, with time you will get a deeper understanding of it.
- For better understanding of Transformers the following videos are highly recommneded
  - [RNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsNTP8Kwu80)
  - [LSTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCzL96nL7j0)

 
<!-- 
### [Week 4: Diving deeper into Natural Language Processing](<./Week 3/>)
This week we will learn about Transformers, the building blocks of ChatGPT
- [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) : Complete the remaining two weeks of the course. You do not need to enroll for the course, you can audit all the content for free (apply for financial aid, then there will be a option to audit the course). You do not need to solve the assignments, just watch the videos on X2. Try to get the basic feel of what AndreNG is trying to teach, it's okay if you don't get all the concepts but going through it at least once is recommended, with time you will get a deeper understanding of it.
- For better understanding of Transformers the following videos are highly recommneded
  - [Attention Mechanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSs6nxngL6k)
  - [Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxQyTK8quyY)
  - ["Attention is all you need" Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
