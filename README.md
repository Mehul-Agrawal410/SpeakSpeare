In the world of growing AI and expeditious evolutions in ML research and applications, there is almost no field which hasn’t leveraged the enormous potential of AI/ML. In the light of growing enthusiasm and buzz about this amazing field, we would like to bring to you an opportunity to get a taste of working on a cool project introducing you to the basics of NLP and related advancements like transformer models and their involved architectures. I am sure by now you would have definitely formally cited and used ChatGPT for various purposes. Have you ever wondered what would have made it work so well with context and possess such a diverse range of functionality? How about making a  miniature model of your own customising it to your purposes? How about reincarnating a 21st century Shakespeare and having him narrating scenes of his plays while you try hard to recall them in your literature exams? Well, it can be made possible. In the period of a few weeks, we will be taking you through the nitty-gritties of basic ML coding frameworks and making you familiar with coding basic ML algorithms. Post that, we will introduce you to the mind-boggling world of NLP and how these models handle and generate text data. We will also be taking you through the basics of the attention mechanism which is commonly used by the model for interpreting context. You will get the opportunity to understand the principles involved in transformer models which have currently become the juggernauts in NLP. You might also be able to learn how to code from scratch:) The final goal will be to train a chatbot using Shakespeare baseline language modelling which can then further be customised to your own dataset. This might have a slightly steep learning curve for absolute beginners but will not be a big deal given enough time, enthusiasm, and perseverance.

## Problem Statement 

Chatbot speaking in Shakespearean language

## Project Phases

### [Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Python](<./Week 1/>)
This week will be a lighter one for those already familiar with Python. For those who are new, we have got you covered. 
- [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) : Watch till 3:36:00, try to write the code and try running them, this goes for all further tutorials 
- [Python Classes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-classes-and-objects/)
- [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)
- [Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)
- [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB9C0Mz9gSo)

### [Week 2: Introduction to Neural Networks and Pytorch](<./Week 2/>)
This week we will learn about what Neural Networds are and how we can implement them using Pytorch
- [Neural Network and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) : You do not need to enroll for the course, you can audit all the content for free (apply for financial aid, then there will be a option to audit the course). You do not need to solve the assignments, just watch the videos on X2. Try to get the basic feel of what AndreNG is trying to teach, it's okay if you don't get all the concepts but going through it at least once is recommended, with time you will get a deeper understanding of it.
- Alternate resources for NN and DL (optional) : [MIT lecture series](https://youtu.be/QDX-1M5Nj7s) and [3Blue1Brown](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
- [Pytorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M) : There will be few new terms such as “linear regression”, “logistic regression” first try to look at google to understand them, if you don’t find relevant resources put on group or DM us ( NOTE : Able to find good resources and documentation is a very important skill while coding)
